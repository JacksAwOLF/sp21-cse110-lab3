Well, we obviously have to plan for an asynchronous standup meeting. 
Here is my basic plan for a weekly standup:

- Everyone takes turn talking about what they did last week
  - this should be really quick, maybe like 1 minute max per person
  - also should include potential 
- Everyone should discuss the tasks facing the team
  - like if someone is stuck and affecting other teams, get more people on it
  - or like the next steps of development
  - since it is asynchronous, we will take turns speaking (predetermined)
- plan out what to do this week
  - using the data from the previous 2 sections of course
  - everyone jot it down on a board
  - team leader will review what tasks needs to be done and assign it to people
  - the people who are assigned tasks will then report back whether or not they can finish

Some rules are: 
1. everyone has to turn video on
2. limit talking to productive things that are relavant to the project
3. limit talking to 1 minute each, if needed we will have larger discussion at the end
4. there will be a person who is taking notes, most likely a team lead who doesn't have much coding to do

Finally, after the meeting, we can discuss more detail at length, and even talk about how effective the meeting was. If needed, all the above should be changed.
