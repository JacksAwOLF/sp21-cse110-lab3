                <h3>This day was my counsin's 17th birthday!</h3>


                <h3>After I finished doing some homework and reading, I went over to my grandma's place where my counsins lived</h3>
                <h4>I have 3 cousins living with their parents and my grandma in one house, it's pretty crazy</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        There's the buff man Billy<br>

                <p>I played basketball and got some drinks with Billy and Andy, then I went back home and played tag and Jenga with Samuel.</p>
                <p>In between I also had a book club meeting with some of my friends that was pretty interesting. We finally expanded from 3 members to 4.</p>
                <p>Then my other cousin Angela and my brother Felix came over and the huge family ate dinner and tiramisu cake</p>

                <h3>So today was a fun day! <br> 
                    First I played 2 hours of <i>fRiSbEe</i> <br> 
                    with three of my good old high school friends</h3>

                <h4>It was a little warm and breezy so I thought it was a pretty good temperature. <br>
                We tried to play an ultimate frisbee game but we quickly all ran out of gas</h4>

                <h3>Then I went to my <em>aunt's</em> house <br>
                     and played some of <em>board games</em> with my counsins.</h3>
                
                <h4>Here are the games we played in order:</h4>

                <ol>   
                    <li>
                        <details>
                            <summary>King of Tokyo</summary>
                            <p>We all get 10 hearts, and draw cards to attack the king of tokyo, who is one of us. The person who is the king of tokyo gets 2 stars every turn, and first to 20 stars wins.</p>
                        </details>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <details>
                            <summary>Gem Collector</summary>
                            <p>Collect victory points by exchanging varying amounts of 5-colored gems for cards. Is harder than it sounds like.</p>
                        </details>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <details>
                            <summary>Tiny Towns</summary>
                            <p>Construct buildings on a 4x4 grid where each building is made of differnt construction blocks that all take up varying amounts of space.</p>
                        </details>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>After that and some chatting, I went back home to do homework</h3>
                <h4>One of my other friends Leon hit me up to ask some questions <br>
                about his CS assignment so I tried my best to help him</h4>
                <img src="media/leon.png" width="200" height="200">

                <h3>And finally, before I start working on this homework assignment<br>
                I talked with Nick and Chris about a game that we are working on. <br></h3>
                <h4>Chris is very excited about the plot of the game and the possibilities that we can have, <br>
                but I am a little worried about the expanding scope of the project honestly</h4>
                <img src="media/chris.png" width="200" height="200">

                <h3>Will I finish the homework in time to add it to the list of things I did today?</h3>
