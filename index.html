                <h4>It was a little warm and breezy so I thought it was a pretty good temperature. <br>
                We tried to play an ultimate frisbee game but we quickly all ran out of gas</h4>

                <h3>Then I went to my <em>aunt's</em> house <br>
                     and played some of <em>board games</em> with my counsins.</h3>

                            <p>We all get 10 hearts, and draw cards to attack the king of tokyo, who is one of us. The person who is the king of tokyo gets 2 stars every turn, and first to 20 stars wins.</p>

                            <p>Collect victory points by exchanging varying amounts of 5-colored gems for cards. Is harder than it sounds like.</p>

                            <p>Construct buildings on a 4x4 grid where each building is made of differnt construction blocks that all take up varying amounts of space.</p>

                <h3>After that and some chatting, I went back home to do homework</h3>
                <h4>One of my other friends Leon hit me up to ask some questions <br>
                about his CS assignment so I tried my best to help him</h4>

                <h3>And finally, before I start working on this homework assignment<br>
                I talked with Nick and Chris about a game that we are working on. <br></h3>
                <h4>Chris is very excited about the plot of the game and the possibilities that we can have, <br>
